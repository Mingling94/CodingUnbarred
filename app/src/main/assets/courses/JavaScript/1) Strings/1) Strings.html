<h2>Lesson 1: Strings</h2>

<p>In JavaScript a bunch of letters, numbers, words or anything else is known as a String, as in a string of characters.
Strings begin AND end with a quotation mark. Single &#39; or double &quot; is fine, just make sure you use the same at the 
beginning as you do at the end.</p>

<p>A string can be any sequence, including a basic sentence like this:</p>

<p>&quot;learning how to code is fun&quot;</p>

<p> Here are more examples of all the things that can be strings:</p>
<div class="code">
	<p>&quot;Hello World!&quot;</p>
	<p>&quot;3.14159&quot;</p>
	<p>&quot;6 + 10 = 16&quot;</p>
</div>
<p> As you can see, as long as you put quotation marks around it, almost anything can be a string! However, for some special
characters, such as quotation marks, apostrophes, backslash (\), you need to use what's called an <b> escape sequence </b>. To escape these characters, you need to write a backslash before the character in your string. For example, if you wanted to write a string that would display "Hello world!" enclosed in quotation marks, you would have to write "\"Hello world!\"" in your JavaScript. </p>

<p>Try typing out different strings and using escape sequences for special characters!</p>
