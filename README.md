# CodingUnbarred
Coding Unbarred is a self-education Android app geared towards teaching prisoners with access to Android tablets but no internet about web development.

## Background
Unloop, the nonprofit driving this project, works with people in prisons to empower them with coding skills which helps reduce recidivism. To this end, there is a clear coding curriculum in place, which is primarily an instructor involved training. Now, we are trying to make the learning possible at all times, even when there is no instructor around. Partnerships with other NGOs and organizations have secured a sufficient number of Android tablets, that will be accessible to the inmates. What remains to be built is the learning software.
